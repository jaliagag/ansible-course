# Ansible by GeerlingGuy

- `vagrant init`
- modify the created Vagrant file like the one on this repo, called Vagrantfile_template1
- `vagrant up` while cd on the folder
- `ansible multi -i inventory -a "hostname"` - change "hostname" to "df -h" or whatever you want to use as adhoc
- `ansible -i inventory db -m setup` - see information about a specific machine - similar to gather facts
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -m yum -a "name=ntp state=present"` installs a package - we can use --become instead of -b; by default it's root; -K or --ask-become-pass to request a pass to become sudo (by default vagrant user can become sudo, no need to prompt for password - default pass for vagrant user is 'vagrant')
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -m service -a "name=ntpd state=started enabled=yes"` start the service and enable it

- `ansible-doc service` - see all information about the service module - if it has a **=** it is mandatory; else, it's optional; same information as the webpage

- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -a "ntpdate -q 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org"` - update, force update of time!
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -m service -a "name=ntpd state=xxxx`

## Running on the background

- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "yum -y update"` - we receive a job id to check the progress of the server
- `ansible -i inventory <servername> -b -m async_status -a "jid=<>"` - 
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -a "tail /var/log/messages"` - check logs
- `anisble -i inventory multi -b -m shell -a "tail /var/log/messages | grep ansible-command | wc -l"` - not a best practice
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -m cron -aa "name=something hour=4 job=/path/to/srcipt.sh"` - to delete state=absent
- `ansible -i inventory multi -b -m git -a "repo=github_url_goes_here dest=/opt/app update=yes version=1.2.3` - update a server git repository

- to end the laboratory: `vagrant destroy -f`
